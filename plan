Screen Handler:
	tells the graphics engine what screen to draw
	controls switching screens

Screens are composed of two parts:
	ScreenView
		contains entities and controls to be drawn
		handles input and sends it to controller
	ScreenController
		accepts input from view
		does logicy stuff
		tells screen handler when to switch to a new screen
		May interact with models/data


Example: Gameplay (a ScreenController)
	will maintain state: i.e, even though it will be re-called
	multiple times, it's not being reinstantiated (it's a singleton)
	so the state stays the same. State might be the current turn number,
	the round number, whether or not to display an auction, etc.
